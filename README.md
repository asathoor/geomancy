## Based on Cornelius Agrippa's "De Occulta Philosophia" (1533)

The fortunes random quotes are often used in UNIX / Linux systems for random quotes. But a connection to the art of fortune telling as taugt by the hermetic philosophers were never made.

The origin of the geomantic figures are unknown. We know that geomanct was known by renaissance magi. Geomantic fortune symbols are described by Agrippa von Nettesheim in the chapter: *"De Geomantia, Hydromantia, Acromantia, Pyromantiaquatuor elementorum diuinationibus" (Cap. LV"* in "De Occulta Philosophia" (1531 - 1533) and in the illustrations of this work.

The geomantic figures were used by the adepti of the *Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn* (est. ca. 1888). Aleister Crowley (1874 - 1947) used geomancy on a regular basis, which is evident in his diaries.
